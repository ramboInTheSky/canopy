# Canopy
Welcome to CanopyðŸŒ²! A project to support webapps at _alz

## Developing

### Prerequisites

```yarn``` is required for this project


### Setup

To build the project run the following steps

To install dependencies for the monorepo, run
```
yarn install
```

To clean all dependencies and generated files for all packages, run
```
yarn run clean
```

To install all dependencies for all packages, run
```
yarn run bootstrap
```

To build all packages, run

### Making Changes

Steps to create a new package

1. add a new package directory to the most fitting directory listed in lerna.json
1. add package.json, gulpfile, tsconfig.json, tslint.json, and src code (Use Card package.json an example)
1. run ```npm run bootstrap``` (this installs all needed dependencies)
1. run ```npm run dev``` (this launches gulp watch on all src files and runs storybook locally)
